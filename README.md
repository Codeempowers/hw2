Please find the netlify link to the Old Kashmiri, an apple orchard homepage and online store:
https://theoldkashmiri.netlify.app

Just making sure that it is seen: I have 2 forms in my project but have only connected 1 to Netlify
1.) One Form is for messages (This one is connected to Netlify - it is accessible when clicking on the email adress in the upper right corner of each screen in order to contact the team)
2.) One Form for orders in the online store (this one is in the Store goes with "action=orders.html" to another page and is not connected to netlify atm)
